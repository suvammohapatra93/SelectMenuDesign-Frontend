# Select Menu Design App

A simple, interactive, and stylish social media selector menu using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates how to create a custom dropdown menu where users can select a social media platform, and the chosen option is displayed in the selection field. It includes smooth transitions and interactive features.


## Features

- Dropdown menu with a list of social media platforms.
- Smooth transition effects when opening and closing the dropdown.
- Selection of an option updates the displayed text and icon.
- Automatically closes the dropdown when clicking outside of it.
- Customizable styling for a modern look.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: The basic structure of the app.
- **CSS3**: For styling the app, including transitions and layout.
- **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)**: To handle the dropdown functionality and user interactions.


# How It Works
When the page loads, you'll see a selection field labeled "Select Social Media".
Click on the field, and a dropdown menu will appear with a list of social media options.
Select any of the options, and the selection field will update to display the chosen social media platform along with its corresponding icon.
The dropdown will close after making a selection, and it can also be closed by clicking outside the dropdown area.
